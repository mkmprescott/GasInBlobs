Blue-side data stored in /blue
Red-side data stored in /red

Directories in each case:
velo/ - measured nebula in 1 pixel apertures stepping across nebula
velobin/ - measured nebula in 5 pixel apertures stepping across nebula
wide/ - measured total flux from nebula in wider and wider apertures

Line measured is given as one of the following: lya, heii, civ, ciii, neiv, nv, siiv, oii
e.g., casdPRG1_A_B.skywide.oii.dat

casd - prefix telling which data reduction steps have been applied (all of them in this case)
PRG1 - name of nebula
_A or _MID - slit being measured, where A is the 146deg slit and MID is the 52deg slit
_B - means centered on the blob itself
skywide / skyvelo / skyvelobin - the type of measurement (as above)
combo - for the blue data only, I combined the data from both observing runs.  For the red data, I could only use the second run (after the upgrade) so it is not "combo"

.fits and .dat file contain exactly the same information in FITS vs. ASCII format.

In IDL, one would read in as:
IDL> readcol, 'casdPRG1_A_B.skywide.oii.dat', AP, .... [all the field names here]
or 
IDL> oii = mrdfits('casdPRG1_A_B.skywide.oii.fits') ; reads the whole dataset into an IDL "structure" called oii, where each field is a "tag"
IDL> help, oii, /str ; lists all the tags in the structure
IDL> struct_print, oii ;prints out the structure, this is what is shown in the *.dat file.
